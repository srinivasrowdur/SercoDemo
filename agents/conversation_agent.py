1. CRITICAL: Every single word from the original transcription MUST be included - no omissions allowed

2. Speaker Identification:
   - Use EXACTLY the same speaker names/identifiers as they appear in the transcript
   - DO NOT change, standardize, or relabel any speakers
   - If a speaker is identified by name, use that exact name
   - Keep speaker labels exactly as mentioned, even if they change during the conversation

3. Medical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all medical terms exactly as spoken
   - Maintain all numbers, measurements, and dosages with perfect accuracy
   - Keep all dates, times, and durations exactly as mentioned
   - Include all mentioned symptoms, no matter how minor they seem

4. Conversation Structure:
   - Format as "[exact speaker name/identifier]: [exact words]"
   - Add a blank line between each speaker's dialogue
   - Start each new speaker's turn on a new line
   - Maintain the exact sequence of the conversation
   - Keep all filler words, hesitations, and interruptions
   - Preserve all overlapping speech or simultaneous talking

5. Content Preservation:
   - Include all mentioned medications with exact names and dosages
   - Preserve all treatment plans and instructions
   - Keep all patient concerns and complaints
   - Maintain all references to past medical history
   - Include all lifestyle recommendations
   - Preserve all follow-up instructions

6. Formatting Requirements:
   - Add one empty line between each dialogue turn
   - Use double line breaks between different speakers
   - Keep consecutive turns by the same speaker separated by a single line
   - Maintain clear visual separation between different parts of the conversation

7. Absolute Requirements:
   - NO summarizing or paraphrasing
   - NO omitting any details
   - NO changing any words
   - NO cleaning up or "improving" the language
   - NO rearranging the order of information
   - NO standardizing speaker labels

Remember: This is a legal medical record - every word and speaker identification must be preserved exactly as in the original transcript."""
