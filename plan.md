# Architectural Improvement Plan

## 1. Error Handling Enhancement

### Current Issues
- ~~Inconsistent error handling across different components~~ ✓
- ~~Basic error messages without detailed context~~ ✓
- ~~No standardized error logging mechanism~~ ✓
- ~~Limited error recovery and retry mechanisms~~ ✓
- ~~Insufficient error tracking and analytics~~ ✓
- Lack of proactive error prevention

### Proposed Improvements
1. Implement a centralized error handling system
   - ~~Create custom error classes for different types of errors~~ ✓
     * ~~AudioProcessingError for audio file handling issues~~ ✓
     * ~~TranscriptionError for speech-to-text failures~~ ✓
     * ~~ConversationError for dialogue processing problems~~ ✓
     * ~~APIError for external service communication issues~~ ✓
   - ~~Standardize error message format with error codes~~ ✓
   - ~~Implement error severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)~~ ✓

2. Enhanced error logging and monitoring
   - ~~Implement structured logging with contextual information~~ ✓
     * ~~Timestamp and error location~~ ✓
     * ~~User session information~~ ✓
     * ~~System state at time of error~~ ✓
     * ~~Complete stack traces for debugging~~ ✓
   - ~~Add error analytics and monitoring~~ ✓
     * ~~Track error frequency and patterns~~ ✓
     * ~~Monitor error resolution time~~ ✓
     * ~~Generate error reports for analysis~~ ✓

3. User-friendly error handling
   - ~~Create clear, actionable error messages~~ ✓
     * ~~Plain language descriptions~~ ✓
     * ~~Specific error codes for support reference~~ ✓
     * ~~Step-by-step recovery instructions~~ ✓
   - ~~Implement automatic error recovery where possible~~ ✓
     * ~~Retry mechanisms for transient failures~~ ✓
     * ~~Graceful degradation options~~ ✓
     * ~~Session state preservation~~ ✓
   - Add user feedback mechanisms
     * Error reporting interface
     * Support ticket integration
     * User satisfaction tracking

4. Error Prevention Strategies
